# Mouse-Tumor-Analysis


## Objective:

As you can see the Capomulin and Ramicane are the leading and most effective vaccines with notable decreases in tumor volume and less variance in volume at the final time stamp. 
Both vaccines show promise and would be worth while in a deeper analysis with a larger body of subjects. The bar graph shows that the more effective reatments were also the two leading treatments showing a positive correlation.
